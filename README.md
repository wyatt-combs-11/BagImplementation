# BagImplementation
Two implementations of the bag ADT

This project was to implement a bag interface that accepted generic types. I created array and LinkedList classes that implemented the GIVEN bag interface. These objects could be checked against each other and take in all types of objects.

The two implementations are LinkedBag and ArrayBag which are both tested in the JUnit. There is also the bag Interface file that shows the given interface. This was the only code I did not write.
